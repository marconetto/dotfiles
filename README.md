# disclaimer

Dotfiles are very dependent on user taste. I'm making my (not up to date)
dotfiles available in case someone may benefit from them. There are actually
very nice customizations I have done/collected over the years and as I have some time
available and will descrive those here.


I also like to have a very clean look and feel. So here is a screenshot of my
desktop:
